# Data Integrity Specification

We encourage contributions meeting the [Contribution Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).
While we prefer the creation of issues and Pull Requests in the GitHub
repository, discussions often occur on the
[public-vc-wg](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-vc-wg/) mailing list
as well.
